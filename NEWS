1.20 - 2010.08.04
 * ASF: Don't store blocks over 64K in the MetadataObject block;
   use the MetadataLibraryBlock instead. (#60, Lukáš Lalinský)

   * Add --quiet and --verbose flags. (#40)
 * moggsplit: --m3u option to write an M3U playlist of the new files. (#39)
 * mid3iconv: Fix crash when processing TCML or TIPL frames. (#41)

     1.17 accidentally contained a circular import preventing
     mutagen.easyid3 from importing by itself. (#32)
